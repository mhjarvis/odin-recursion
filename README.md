Solutions to the Recursion project found at [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion#solutions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion#solutions). 

### Assignment 1:

1. Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

2. Now write another method fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just a couple of lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).

### Assignment 2:

1. Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

2. Tips:
  - Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).
  - It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you don’t quite understand what should be going on.
